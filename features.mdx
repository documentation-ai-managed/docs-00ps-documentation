      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query, aiMode: true })
    });
    return response.json();
  };
  ```
  ```python
  import requests

  def baidu_search(query):
      response = requests.post(
          'https://api.baidu.com/search',
          headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
